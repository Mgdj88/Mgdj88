Ensure that the display_game_screen(), get_player_bid(), generate_opponents_bids(), play_trick(), determine_winning_card(), update_game_stats(), and game_over() functions are properly defined and implemented to handle the corresponding game mechanics.

Make sure that the winning_card.player property is correctly assigned in the determine_winning_card() function or method, so that it can be properly compared in the following conditional statement.

Double-check that the game loop logic and conditions in the while loop are properly designed to handle the game flow, including the termination condition for the loop when the game is over.

Verify that the spade_coins and player_wins variables are correctly updated based on the game mechanics and rules, and that their initial values are appropriately set.

Consider using proper data types and error handling techniques, such as validating user input, handling exceptions, and managing potential edge cases to ensure the stability and correctness of the code.

Additionally, make sure that any necessary game assets, such as card images or other graphical elements, are properly loaded and displayed in the display_game_screen() function or method.

Finally, thoroughly test the code with different scenarios and edge cases to identify and fix any potential issues or bugs.
